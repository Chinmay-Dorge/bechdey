### Predict the Price to rent for an item

The [Decision Tree Model](https://github.com/Chinmay-Dorge/rentway-ml) is being used in RentWay to determine the appropriate rental price for a given clothing item. The model takes into account several factors, such as the brand, type of clothing and other factors to give a prediction of the rental price of the item. The model takes 12 input parameters and has made a decision tree using the same
